1. [Islands](https://open.kattis.com/problems/islands3){:target="_blank"}\
Breadth First Search. You can also solve it with Depth First Search or any graph traversal algorithms. \
Tip: mark each cell as visited for each up, down, left, right check to avoid duplicate cell in the queue.
```
    def bfs(image, visited, y, x):
        q = deque()
        q.append((x,y))

        while q:  
            (x,y) = q.popleft()
            # up
            if y - 1 >= 0 and not visited[y - 1][x] and image[y - 1][x] in ['L', 'C']:
                q.append((x, y-1))
                visited[y-1][x] = True

            # down
            if y + 1 < len(image) and not visited[y + 1][x] and image[y + 1][x] in ['L', 'C']:
                q.append((x, y+1))
                visited[y+1][x] = True

            # left
            if x - 1 >= 0 and not visited[y][x - 1] and image[y][x - 1] in ['L', 'C']:
                q.append((x-1, y))
                visited[y][x-1] = True

            # right
            if x + 1 < len(image[0]) and not visited[y][x + 1] and image[y][x + 1] in ['L', 'C']:
                q.append((x+1, y))
                visited[y][x+1] = True

    // create graph here ...

    // count islands
    visited = [[False for i in range(c)] for j in range(r)]
    count = 0
    for (x, y) in lands:
        if not visited[y][x]:
            bfs(image, visited, y, x)
            count += 1

2. [Cantina of Babel](https://open.kattis.com/problems/cantinaofbabel){:target="_blank"}\
Create 2 maps, languages people can speak and languages people can understand.
Build a directed graph by adding arrows from people who can speak a language to people who can understand the same language. Then create a transposed graph by reversing the arrows.

We want to find the largest SCC. The result equals to the number of people subtract the number of people in the largest SCC. We will use Kosaraju algorithm.
```
    visited = set()
    graph: hashmap<name, list of names>
    transposed_graph: hashmap<name, list of names>
    stack = []

    function Kosaraju (start, transpose): // transpose: True or False
        visited.add(start)
        neighbours = transpose ? transposed_graph[start] : graph[start]
        for each n in neighbours:
            if n not in visited:
                Kosaraju(n, transpose)
        stack.append(start)

    // build graph, transposed graph here ....

    // find SCCs
    for name, neighbours in graph.items():
        if name not in visited:
            Kosaraju(name, False)

    visited.clear()
    while stack:
        u = stack.pop()
        if u not in visited:
            Kosaraju(u, True)
```
Notice that Kosaraju is just DFS.
