## About us
The UVic Competitive Programming Club is a group of students who enjoy solving programming problems. We compete annually in the [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/){:target="_blank"}, and meet weekly to practice and discuss algorithms.

If you would like to compete in programming contests or just want to improve your programming skills, join us! Anyone with basic programming ability is welcome.
